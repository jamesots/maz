Libraries/intermediate files can be JSON
Can read settings from a local file, a system wide file or a file specified on the command line
Have option to change JR to JP if out of range
Make sure error messages are actually useful

Compile all the file into a list of compiled objects.
Create a map of symbols
Calculate symbol values
Throw error if symbol values can't be caluclated (circular refs, etc)


Below, 'more' cannot be calculated.

start:
    jp more
    ds more-start
more:
    ret

Are there any other instructions or directives which change the size of the data? Maybe only a ds directive needs to disallow forward references â€” so calculate its size as we go. Although a later 'equ' would be valid:

start:
    jp more
    ds size
more:
    ret
size: equ 100
